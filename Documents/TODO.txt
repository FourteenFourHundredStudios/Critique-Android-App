Critique Android App Fixes:

    optimisations:
        do not load mutuals on first onResume()
        figure out optimal time to inflate views in Queue

    aesthetics: 
        redesign profile page:
            create cool coordinator layout for profile page info
            redesign the way post previews look
        redesign mutual selection activity
            add cooler blue checkbox next to user selection
        posts should have real date and time
        posts should show real number of votes
        [DONE] redesign post title:
            [DONE] Maybe make date username, and username title?
            [DONE] Maybe make the actionbar just say "Queue"?
        Bring back loading sign


    framework:
        userAdapter should also handle selections (for mutual selection activity)
        create adapter for post previews
        Lazy scrolling loading for RecyclerView adapters


    code cleanup:
        make post views no longer views, instead, make them a part of the framework
        reusable, standardized components like username bar, and information bar
        make variables private, with corresponding getters and setters 
        figure out how to organise layouts into seperate files
        standardise view IDs 
        create Framework package
        better modularisation
